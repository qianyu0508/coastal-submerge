Another hypothesis argues that the island was formed by earthquake-induced landslide deposits near the Oita River mouth and subsequently disappeared due to liquefaction, tsunami, and erosion.

The stepped landforms may indicate long-term tectonic subsidence possibly linked to the Nankai earthquake zone or the Median Tectonic Line fault system.

Gradual processes accounted for about 4–5 m of subsidence over ~2500 years, while sudden flood-induced sediment remobilization and structural loading caused an additional 3–4 m of rapid lowering, leading to their final submergence at 5–7 m water depth.
